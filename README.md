### PBS license checker
Small scripts that query various license servers (FlexNet, LM-X, LSTC) and return a single integer represent available licenses for a particular feature. With thanks to Adarsh of Altair https://community.openpbs.org/t/how-to-manage-flexnet-licensing-in-pbs-pro/1025/2

To configure PBS Professional / OpenPBS to handle software that has 'floating' network licenses controlled by services such as FLEXNet, Reprise, LM-X do this:

use one of these scripts, customising as necessary, making sure it is executable, owned and only writable by the PBS server user (usually root)

	qmgr -c "create resource lic_foo type=long"

edit *$PBS_HOME/sched_priv/sched_config* to include the new resource name in the list of resources:

	resources: "ncpus, aoe, â€¦,lic_foo"

and a new dynamic resource line telling the scheduler how to get the value for the resource:

	server_dyn_res: "lic_foo !/usr/local/bin/lic_avail_foo.sh"

send a HUP signal to the scheduler

	pkill -HUP pbs_sched

to test you can submit two jobs, one requesting more licenses than will ever be available and one requesting a sane value

	qsub -N too_many_lics -l lic_foo=99999 -- /bin/sleep 1m
	qsub -N resonable_lics -l lic_foo=1 -- /bin/sleep 1m

qstat should then show the first job queued, and the second running.

Note the potential for a race condition if the software takes a long time from being started to actually claiming a license out from its server. CD-Adapco's STAR-CCM+ is one example of this, with PBS correctly verifying that a (single) license was available, starting the CCM job, but CCM itself going through a long preamble before contactiong the license server to claim a license, during which time another job could be submitted then, because a license is still 'available' started by PBS. Solving this might require the use of license reservation features, if supported.
